    "\n",
    "This section imports all the Python libraries we'll use throughout the project.\n",

    "What each library does and WHY we need it:\n",
    "- kagglehub: Downloads datasets directly from Kaggle (a platform for data science datasets)\n",
    "- pandas (pd): The main tool for working with tabular data (think Excel, but in Python)\n",
    "            We use it to load, clean, and manipulate our transaction data\n",
    "- numpy (np): Handles numerical computations efficiently (fast math on large datasets)\n",
    "- matplotlib.pyplot (plt): Creates basic plots and visualizations to understand our data\n",
    "- seaborn (sns): Builds on matplotlib to create more sophisticated and visually appealing charts\n",
    "- warnings: Manages warning messages (we'll suppress them to keep output clean)\n",
    "- os: Handles file system operations (checking paths, listing files, etc.)\n",

    "STEP 12: ANALYZING FRAUD RATE BY TRANSACTION TYPE\n",
    "==================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY is this important?\n",
    "Some transaction types might be more vulnerable to fraud than others.\n",
    "This helps us identify high-risk transaction types.\n",
    "\n",
    "How this works:\n",
    "1. df.groupby(\"type\"): Groups transactions by type (all PAYMENTs together, all TRANSFERs together, etc.)\n",
    "2. [\"isFraud\"].mean(): Calculates the average of isFraud for each group\n",
    "   - Since isFraud is 0 or 1, the mean = fraud rate (percentage as decimal)\n",
    "   - Example: 0.05 = 5% fraud rate\n",
    "3. .sort_values(ascending=False): Sorts from highest to lowest fraud rate\n",
    "4. .plot(kind=\"bar\"): Creates a bar chart to visualize the results\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're looking for:\n",
    "- Which transaction types have the HIGHEST fraud rate?\n",
    "- Are certain types completely safe (0% fraud)?\n",
    "- This helps prioritize which types need more security measures\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected insights:\n",
    "- TRANSFER and CASH_OUT typically have higher fraud rates\n",
    "- PAYMENT might be safer (more monitored)\n",
    "- CASH_IN and DEBIT might have very low fraud rates\n",
    "\n",
    "HOW to use this:\n",
    "In production, you might apply stricter checks to high-risk transaction types.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate and visualize the fraud rate for each transaction type\n",
    "# This identifies which transaction types are most susceptible to fraud\n",
    "fraud_by_type = df.groupby(\"type\")[\"isFraud\"].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)\n",

    "====================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY analyze transaction amounts?\n",
    "Understanding the distribution of transaction amounts helps us:\n",
    "- Identify typical transaction sizes\n",

    "- std: Standard deviation (how spread out the amounts are)\n",
    "- min: Smallest transaction amount\n",

    "- 50%: Median (middle value - half above, half below)\n",
    "- 75%: Third quartile (75% of transactions are below this amount)\n",
    "- max: Largest transaction amount\n",
    "\n",
    "What .astype(int) does:\n",
    "Converts decimal numbers to whole numbers for easier reading\n",
    "(we don't need exact cents for this overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "What to look for:\n",
    "- Large difference between mean and median? Data is skewed (has outliers)\n",
    "- Large std (standard deviation)? Amounts vary widely\n",

    "=====================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY use log scale?\n",
    "Transaction amounts are highly skewed: most are small, but a few are HUGE.\n",
    "On a normal scale, the chart would show one giant bar for small amounts and nothing else.\n",
    "Log transformation helps us see the full distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this code does:\n",
    "1. np.log1p(df[\"amount\"]): Applies log transformation\n",
    "   - log1p = log(1 + x), which handles zero amounts safely\n",
    "   - Compresses large values, spreads out small values\n",
    "2. sns.histplot(): Creates a histogram with density curve (kde=True)\n",
    "   - bins=100: Divides data into 100 bins for granularity\n",
    "   - kde=True: Adds a smooth curve showing the distribution shape\n",

    "   WHY? To remove extreme outliers that would compress the useful part of the chart\n",

    "STEP 20: TEMPORAL ANALYSIS - FRAUD OVER TIME\n",
    "=============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY analyze fraud over time?\n",
    "Fraudsters might operate at specific times (e.g., off-hours when monitoring is lax).\n",
    "Understanding temporal patterns helps with:\n",
    "- Resource allocation (more monitoring during high-fraud periods)\n",
    "- Anomaly detection (unusual spikes in fraud)\n",
    "- Pattern recognition (periodic fraud attempts)\n",
    "\n",
    "How this works:\n",
    "1. df[df[\"isFraud\"] == 1]: Filter to only fraudulent transactions\n",
    "2. [\"step\"].value_counts(): Count frauds at each time step\n",
    "3. .sort_index(): Sort by time (step) for proper time series visualization\n",
    "4. plt.plot(): Creates a line chart showing fraud count over time\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're looking for:\n",
    "- Consistent fraud rate over time? Or spikes at certain periods?\n",
    "- Increasing trend? (fraud getting worse over time)\n",
    "- Periodic patterns? (fraud attempts every N time steps)\n",
    "- Any time periods with zero fraud? (unusually quiet or data issues?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected patterns:\n",
    "Fraud might be constant, clustered at certain times, or show periodic spikes\n",
    "depending on fraudster behavior and detection system effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note about 'step':\n",
    "Each step represents a time unit (typically 1 hour in this simulation).\n",
    "The dataset simulates 30 days of transactions.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analyze fraud distribution over time (by step/time period)\n",
    "# This line chart shows if fraud occurs more frequently at certain times\n",

    "STEP 21: REMOVING TIME FEATURE\n",
    "===============================\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY remove the 'step' column?\n",
    "While time analysis was useful for exploration, the 'step' feature may not generalize well\n",
    "to real-world fraud detection for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulation artifact: This is simulated data where 'step' is artificial\n",
    "2. Poor generalization: A fraud pattern at \"step 150\" in training data won't help\n",
    "   predict fraud at \"step 151\" in production (time is continuous, not discrete)\n",
    "3. Better alternatives: In production, you'd use actual features like:\n",
    "   - Hour of day (0-23)\n",
    "   - Day of week (Monday-Sunday)\n",
    "   - Is weekend? (boolean)\n",
    "   - Is business hours? (boolean)\n",
    "\n",
    "What inplace=True means:\n",
    "The DataFrame is modified directly (no copy is created).\n",
    "This saves memory but means we can't undo this operation easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use time features:\n",
    "- In production, extract meaningful time features (hour, day, month)\n",
    "- Create binary features (is_weekend, is_night, is_holiday)\n",
    "- Use cyclical encoding for time (sin/cos transformation)\n",
    "These generalize much better than raw time steps!\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove the 'step' column as it won't generalize well for prediction\n",
    "# Time-based features should be more meaningful (hour of day, day of week, etc.)\n",

    "STEP 27: VISUALIZING FRAUD IN HIGH-RISK TYPES\n",
    "==============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY create this visualization?\n",
    "We want to see the actual fraud distribution within TRANSFER and CASH_OUT transactions.\n",
    "This shows both the volume of each type AND how much fraud exists in each.\n",
    "\n",
    "What sns.countplot does:\n",
    "1. x=\"type\": Creates bars for each transaction type\n",
    "2. hue=\"isFraud\": Splits each bar into two colors:\n",
    "   - One color for legitimate (isFraud=0)\n",
    "   - Another color for fraudulent (isFraud=1)\n",
    "3. Shows both absolute numbers and relative proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "How to read this chart:\n",
    "- Height of bar = total transactions of that type\n",
    "- Colored segments = fraudulent vs legitimate within that type\n",
    "- Can visually compare fraud rates between TRANSFER and CASH_OUT\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're looking for:\n",
    "- Which type has more total fraud (absolute numbers)?\n",
    "- Which type has higher fraud RATE (proportion)?\n",
    "- Is fraud visible as a significant portion or tiny sliver?\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected insight:\n",
    "Even in high-risk types, fraud is still a small minority - but much more\n",
    "common than in PAYMENT transactions. The visualization makes this\n",
    "immediately apparent.\n",

    "STEP 28: CORRELATION ANALYSIS\n",
    "==============================\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY calculate correlations?\n",
    "Correlation shows how features relate to each other and to fraud.\n",
    "This helps us:\n",
    "- Identify strong predictors of fraud (high correlation with isFraud)\n",
    "- Detect multicollinearity (features that are redundant)\n",
    "- Understand feature relationships before modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "What .corr() does:\n",
    "Calculates Pearson correlation coefficient between all numeric columns.\n",
    "Values range from -1 to +1:\n",
    "- +1: Perfect positive correlation (as one increases, other increases)\n",
    "- 0: No correlation (no linear relationship)\n",
    "- -1: Perfect negative correlation (as one increases, other decreases)\n",
    "\n",
    "How to interpret correlation values:\n",
    "- 0.0 to 0.3: Weak correlation\n",
    "- 0.3 to 0.7: Moderate correlation\n",
    "- 0.7 to 1.0: Strong correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "What we're looking for:\n",
    "1. Which features correlate with isFraud? (potential predictors)\n",
    "2. Which features correlate with each other? (redundancy)\n",
    "   - oldbalanceOrg & newbalanceOrig: Expected high correlation (related balances)\n",
    "   - oldbalanceDest & newbalanceDest: Similar expectation\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY include only these columns:\n",
    "We select numeric features relevant to modeling, excluding account names\n",
    "and other non-numeric data.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate correlation matrix for numeric features\n",
    "# This reveals relationships between features and identifies potential predictors of fraud\n",

    "===============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY create a heatmap?\n",
    "Numbers in a correlation matrix are hard to scan quickly.\n",
    "A heatmap provides immediate visual understanding through colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this heatmap shows:\n",
    "- Each cell = correlation between two features\n",
    "- Color intensity = strength of correlation\n",
    "- annot=True: Shows actual correlation values in cells\n",
    "- cmap=\"coolwarm\": Red (positive correlation) to Blue (negative correlation)\n",
    "- fmt=\".2f\": Format numbers to 2 decimal places\n",
    "\n",
    "How to read this:\n",
    "- Bright red (close to 1): Strong positive correlation\n",
    "- White (close to 0): No correlation\n",
    "- Bright blue (close to -1): Strong negative correlation\n",
    "- Diagonal is always 1 (feature perfectly correlates with itself)\n",
    "\n",
    "What to look for:\n",
    "1. isFraud row/column: Which features correlate with fraud?\n",
    "   - If amount shows 0.08, there's weak positive correlation (larger amounts slightly more likely fraudulent)\n",
    "2. Feature pairs with high correlation (>0.8):\n",
    "   - oldbalanceOrg & newbalanceOrig: Very high correlation (0.998) - makes sense, they're related!\n",
    "   - Consider removing one if they're too redundant\n",
    "\n",
    "Key insight:\n",
    "If no features show strong correlation with isFraud, fraud detection is challenging\n",
    "(no single feature is a strong predictor). This is typical for fraud - we need\n",

    "1. train_test_split: Splits data into training and testing sets\n",
    "   WHY? We train the model on one portion and test on another (never-seen data)\n",
    "   to evaluate how well it generalizes to new transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. StandardScaler: Normalizes numeric features to similar scales\n",
    "   WHY? Features like 'amount' ($0-$1M) and 'balance' ($0-$10M) have different ranges.\n",
    "   ML algorithms perform better when features are on similar scales (usually mean=0, std=1).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. OneHotEncoder: Converts categorical features to numeric\n",
    "   WHY? ML models only understand numbers. Transaction 'type' (PAYMENT, TRANSFER, etc.)\n",
    "   needs to be converted to binary columns (is_payment, is_transfer, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. LogisticRegression: The ML algorithm we'll use\n",
    "   WHY? Despite the name, it's for classification (fraud vs not fraud).\n",
    "   It's simple, fast, interpretable, and works well as a baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. classification_report, confusion_matrix: Evaluation metrics\n",
    "   WHY? Accuracy alone is misleading with imbalanced data (we'd get 99.87% by always predicting \"not fraud\"!)\n",
    "   We need precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to truly understand performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Pipeline: Chains preprocessing and modeling steps\n",
    "   WHY? Ensures we apply the same transformations to training and test data.\n",
    "   Prevents data leakage and makes code cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ColumnTransformer: Applies different preprocessing to different columns\n",

    "===========================================\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY use a Pipeline?\n",
    "Combines preprocessing and model training into a single object.\n",
    "This ensures consistency and makes deployment easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this Pipeline contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (\"prep\", preprocessor):\n",
    "   - Step 1: Apply preprocessing (scaling + encoding)\n",
    "   - Takes raw data, outputs preprocessed features\n",
    "   - This is the ColumnTransformer we defined in the previous step\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (\"clf\", LogisticRegression(...)):\n",
    "   - Step 2: Apply machine learning algorithm\n",
    "   - \"clf\" = classifier (common abbreviation)\n",
    "   - Takes preprocessed features, outputs fraud predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "LogisticRegression parameters explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. class_weight=\"balanced\":\n",
    "   - CRITICAL for imbalanced data!\n",
    "   - Automatically adjusts for class imbalance\n",
    "   - Gives more weight to the minority class (frauds) during training\n",
    "   - Without this: model would just predict \"not fraud\" for everything\n",
    "   - How it works: weight = total_samples / (n_classes * class_count)\n",
    "     - Fraud (rare): Gets HIGH weight (more important in training)\n",
    "     - Not fraud (common): Gets LOW weight (less important)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. max_iter=1000:\n",
    "   - Maximum number of iterations for optimization\n",
    "   - Default is often 100, but with large datasets we might need more\n",
    "   - If model doesn't converge, increase this number\n",
    "   - Prevents \"not converged\" warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "How the complete pipeline works:\n",
    "New transaction → Preprocessing → Standardized features → Logistic Regression → Fraud probability\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY Logistic Regression?\n",
    "- Simple and interpretable (can see which features matter most)\n",
    "- Fast training (important with 6.3M transactions)\n",
    "- Good baseline model (establish minimum performance level)\n",
    "- Works well with class_weight for imbalanced data\n",
    "- Outputs probabilities (0.0 to 1.0, not just yes/no)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next steps:\n",
    "After training, you could try more advanced models:\n",
    "- Random Forest (ensemble of decision trees)\n",
    "- XGBoost (gradient boosting - very popular for fraud detection)\n",
    "- Neural Networks (if you have enough data and compute)\n",
